# Marketing Proposal

In recent years we have seen a proliferation of mobile games, eSports (making their debut in the 2019 South-East Asian Games in Manila) and hybrid  games (boardgame-themed mobile games). For example, my team has observed growing popularities of various gaming forums in Reddit.com (a social media news platform).

My team has recently developed a machine learning model which classify Reddit posts (from gaming Subreddits) with a high accuracy of 89%. In addition, we have also conducted sentiment analysis for gaming subreddits.

My team will be keen to work with your company to develop new marketing strategies. Firstly, we will continue to enhance our ML model and sentiment analysis tool. The objective is to gather insights from posts (e.g. what makes a game popular) and evaluate if any boardgames created by your company (e.g. the popular puzzle boardgame "Pipe and Rodents") can be converted to a mobile game.
